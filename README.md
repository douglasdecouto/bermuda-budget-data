# Bermuda Budget Data

This repository contains machine-readable data from the offical budget
of the [Goverment of Bermuda](http://gov.bm), suitable for analysis with
tools like Excel, scripts, and databases.

This data is officially disseminated, first in a 300+ page hard-copy to 
legislators, and then eventually as a PDF file, sometimes with OCR and
sometimes without. 

In addition detailed Excel files were obtained via a 
[PATI (Public Access To Information)](https://www.gov.bm/public-access-information-pati) 
request from the Bermuda Government. 

This project compiles most of that data into organized data sets via a 
combination of copying and pasting from Excel files, and manual data entry.

## Data Files

The data is provided in two formats: tab-separated text files under the directory 
`data-csv`; and SQL statements with an accompanying table schema in `data-sql` (in MySQL 
dialect). The SQL files include some data-scrubbing logic to address issues in the 
original source data.

In fact, the text file data is generated by loading a MySQL database, then dumping 
the tables into files.
