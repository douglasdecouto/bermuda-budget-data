# Bermuda Budget Data

This repository contains machine-readable data from the offical budget
of the [Goverment of Bermuda](http://gov.bm), suitable for analysis with
tools like Excel, scripts, and databases.

This data is officially disseminated, first in a 300+ page hard-copy to 
legislators, and then eventually as a PDF file, sometimes with OCR and
sometimes without. 

In addition detailed Excel files were obtained via a 
[PATI (Public Access To Information)](https://www.gov.bm/public-access-information-pati) 
request from the Bermuda Government. 

This project compiles most of that data into organized data sets via a 
combination of copying and pasting from Excel files, and manual data entry.

Special thanks to the Bermuda Government, and Louis Galipeau and Andres Simons
of the Bermuda.IO project, who made the first set of online PDF Budget Books and 
other financial reports available. Their site is now offline but you can find 
some of it on the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20200801084728/http://bermuda.io/)
